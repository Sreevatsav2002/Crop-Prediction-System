# Crop Prediction System


Welcome to the Crop Prediction System repository! This project is designed to help users make informed decisions about crop selection by providing crop recommendations based on various factors. The system uses a Random Forest classifier for prediction and features a user-friendly web interface developed with Flask, HTML, and CSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- Required Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction-system.git
```
2. Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd crop-prediction-system
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```
Your Crop Prediction System should now be running locally. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the user interface.

### Usage
- Visit the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
- Input the required parameters such as soil type, climate conditions, and location.
